=head1 koha-illbackend-libris

Koha ILL Backend for Libris ILL (used in Sweden).

=head1 DOCUMENTATION

The official documentation of the Libris ILL API is available here:
L<http://iller.libris.kb.se/librisfjarrlan/api/doc>

See the "docs" directory for more documentation on this ILL backend.

=head1 MAJOR CHANGES

=over 4

=item * 2019-11-21: Add support for empty form.

=item * 2019-11-26: Add support for multiple sigils. PLEASE NOTE: This changes
the way settings for the Libris backend are stored, from koha-conf.xml to a
separate YAML file. Please see the F<docs/config.pod> for details on the new config.

=item * 2020-05-13: patron_id_field is added as an optional config variable. The
default remains to use the user_id from the Libris data to look up patrons based
on cardnumber, but with this variable the backend can be told to use e.g. userid
or borrowernumber.

=head1 DEVELOPMENT BRANCH (waiting)

A group of Swedish libraries have sponsored a set of ILL-related developments.
Developments that only affect koha-illbackend-libris have been incoroprated into
the master branch. Some developments only affect Koha, and these can be found in
Bugzilla, undergoing Koha QA as usual.

But some developments affect both koha-illbackend-libris and Koha itself. The Koha
parts of these developments are undergoing Koha QA and will make it into some
future version of Koha. Until that happens, we have not incorporated the parts
that affect koha-illbackend-libris into the master branch. If we did this, libraries
would run standard Koha and upgrade koha-illbackend-libris, and things would not
work.

Instead, those developments that affect koha-illbackend-libris and that rely on
changes to Koha that are not yet in a stable version of Koha, have been collected
in a separate branch, called B<waiting>. In order to benefit from the these
developments before the changes to Koha are in Koha, a library must do the
following:

=over 4

=item * Update koha-illbackend-libris and check out the "waiting" branch

=item * Apply the relevant Koha patches to the Koha code running on the server

=back

We would like to stress that the changes to Koha are still in the QA process,
and as a result of this they might be changed before they make it into a stable
version of Koha. Applying these patches/changes to a production system is the
responsibility of the library or other organization running the server.

Here are details of the patches in the waiting-branch and the Koha-patches they
rely on:

=head2 Koha bug 24239 - Let the ILL module set ad hoc hard due dates

This adds a new database field illrequests.date_due. Two sets of changes to
koha-illbackend-libris rely on this:

=head3 Add configuration for choosing due date period setting

This is one patch that can be found in PR 112: L<https://github.com/Libriotech/koha-illbackend-libris/pull/112>

=over 4

=item * Add configuration for choosing due date period setting

=back

=head3 Add support for renewals

This is a set of patches found in PR 114: L<https://github.com/Libriotech/koha-illbackend-libris/pull/114>

=over 4

=item * Add support for renewals

=item * Make renew respect due_date_period configuration

=item * Fix illrequestattributes type due_date_guar/max not updating at renew

=item * Fix due date not saving both guar and max values

=item * Format illrequest.date_due and due_date_guar/max due date

=item * Add missing store() when saving date_due

=back

=head2 Koha bug 22321 - Make it possible to edit illrequests.borrowernumber

One change to koha-illbackend-libris relies on this Koha enhancement.

=head3 Don't update borrowernumber if old illrequest exists

It is found in PR 115: L<https://github.com/Libriotech/koha-illbackend-libris/pull/115>:

=over 4

=item * Don't update borrowernumber if old illrequest exists

=back

=head2 Following up

As the Koha-changes listed above make it into stable versions of Koha (in their
present form, or with changes from the QA process), the related changes to
koha-illbackend-libris will be moved from the "waiting" branch to the "master"
branch, so they will be available to libraries runing Koha and koha-illbackend-libris
"out of the box".
